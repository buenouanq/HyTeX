Pronounced `high tech'.
Short for Hyper TeX.
A play on the term hypertext.



The modern internet is akin the internal combustion engine.
It worked, but it was gross and smelly and loud - So they bolted an exhaust system and muffler to it.
It would overheat - So they had to strap on a coolant system and radiator.
All the countless moving parts rubbing on each other would quickly wear out - So they encased it in a box with oil splashing around in hopes of slowing this.
Over the last hundred+ years, they tooled and played with it and made it work and all fit together, until they arrived at what we have today.
By some counts perhaps, an incredible feat of engineering - By other, an absolutely disgusting mess.
Yes, it works - But it's not ideal.
Especially when compared to the electric motor - Invented for automobile use first, but had all but been ignored until recently.

TeX is the ignored electric motor of web design.
